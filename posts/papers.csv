Approximating Heavy Traffic with Brownian Motion,Harvey Barnhard,November 2018,UChicago Summer Math REU 2018,papers/hbarnhard_2018.pdf,"This expository paper shows how waiting times of certain queuing systems can be approximated by Brownian motion. In particular, when customers exit a queue at a slightly faster rate than they enter, the waiting time of the nth customer can be approximated by the supremum of reflected Brownian motion with negative drift."

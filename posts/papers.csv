Ordinal Classification with Probability Constraints,Harvey Barnhard,12/2/2021,Work in Progress,papers/hbarnhard_2021.pdf,"I develop methods to classify observations into 'best' and 'worst' sets while maintaining a bound on the probability of a pairwise directional error between the best and worst set. Relative to frequentist multiple-testing approaches, Bayesian posterior inference substantially increases our ability to infer best from worst. Moreover, I show that Bayesian posterior inference displays remarkably attractive frequentist error rates."
Economic Shocks and Civil Conflict: Fifteen Years Later,Harvey Barnhard,Mar-19,Undergraduate Honors Econometrics Final Project,papers/hbarnhard_2019.pdf,"Revisiting Miguel, Satyanath, and Sergenti (2004), which aims to understand the causal effect of economic shocks on civil conflict in sub-Saharan Africa."
Approximating Heavy Traffic with Brownian Motion,Harvey Barnhard,Nov-18,UChicago Summer Math REU 2018,papers/hbarnhard_2018.pdf,"This expository paper shows how waiting times of certain queuing systems can be approximated by Brownian motion. In particular, when customers exit a queue at a slightly faster rate than they enter, the waiting time of the nth customer can be approximated by the supremum of reflected Brownian motion with negative drift."

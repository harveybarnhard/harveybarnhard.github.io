	<h2> How many hours per week do I endure? </h2>
	<p>
		The interactive chart below displays the amount of time I have spent
		running,
		cycling, and pursuing other endurance sports such as swimming and hiking.
		For example, in June 2020 I hit nearly 20 hours per week of activity,
		and in the first week of December 2019 I barely ran more than two hours
		per week as I was preparing for an intense UChicago finals season.

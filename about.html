        Originally from Indianapolis,
        I graduated from the University of Chicago in 2020 with a B.S.
        in Statistics, a B.A. in Economics,
        and a hefty amount of math.
        I am currently working as a pre-doctoral fellow at <a href="https://opportunityinsights.org/">Opportunity Insights</a>,
        where I am doing my part to identify barriers to economic opportunity.

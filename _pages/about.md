I am an economics PhD student at Harvard University. I focus on applied and theoretical
econometrics. My empirical research interests include health inequality, housing policy, and intergenerational mobility.

I graduated from the University of Chicago in 2020 with a BS in statistics and a BA in economics.
Prior to my PhD studies, I worked for two years as a pre-doctoral fellow at Opportunity Insights.

    <div class="about-text">
        <p>I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Harvard University, specializing in theoretical and applied econometrics. My research develops new statistical methods for robust decision-making, particularly for the kinds of noisy, high-dimensional, and interdependent data that are common in economics.</p>
        <p>I graduated from the University of Chicago in 2020 with a BS in statistics and a BA in economics.
Prior to my PhD studies, I worked for two years as a pre-doctoral fellow at Opportunity Insights, where I contributed to large-scale empirical projects on economic mobility using large administrative datasets.</p>

abstract: I develop methods to classify observations into 'best' and 'worst' sets while maintaining a bound on the probability of a pairwise directional error between the best and worst set. Relative to frequentist multiple-testing approaches, Bayesian posterior inference substantially increases our ability to infer best from worst. Moreover, I show that Bayesian posterior inference displays remarkably attractive frequentist error rates.

I am a pre-doctoral fellow at {{< staticref "https://opportunityinsights.org/" "newtab" >}}Opportunity Insights{{< /staticref >}} at Harvard. 
Starting in Fall 2022, I will attend the PhD program in economics at Harvard University.
I graduated from the University of Chicago in 2020 with a BS in statistics and a BA in economics.
